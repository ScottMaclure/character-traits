# Character Traits

http://scottmaclure.github.io/character-traits/

## Overview

Helper tool for generating (N)PC character traits for your pen-n-paper roleplaying games.

Have this open on your mobile, laptop, tablet, pc etc, and use it to quickly generate some interesting traits for roleplaying NPCs in games.

Handy for improv style GMing, or during prep for the more meticulous GMs out there.

## Development

```
npm install
gulp
```

## Running a local server

`./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server`

http://localhost:8080/

## Publishing to gh-pages

For my reference:

```
cp -pr public/* ../character-traits-gh-pages/
```

Yeh, that's a bit manual. Gulp task?
